# Proof Chips Mapping

| Chip | Claim | Evidence Artifact | Metric / Proof | Status | Recruiter Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Academics | ASU B.S. Software Engineering — 3.59 GPA | `content/proof/asu-bse.md` | Official transcript (upload pending) | Draft | Shows sustained academic rigor in accredited SWE program. |
| Mentorship | SER321 Distributed Software Systems Undergraduate TA | `content/proof/ser321-ta.md` | Faculty confirmation + syllabus excerpt (pending) | Draft | Demonstrates mastery of distributed systems and trust to guide peers through hardest course. |
| Delivery | React capstone (NDA) — Delivered production-ready components under confidentiality | `content/proof/capstone-nda.md` | Sanitized case study with professor sign-off (pending) | Draft | Signals ability to ship reliable features on schedule even under constraints. |

**Outstanding for Task 1.1**
- Attach transcript or registrar letter to `content/proof/asu-bse.md` before marking the Academics chip “Ready.”
- Collect faculty confirmation and summarize TA deliverables in `content/proof/ser321-ta.md` so the Mentorship chip is evidence-backed.
- Draft the NDA-safe case study package for `content/proof/capstone-nda.md` (architecture snapshot, testimonial, redacted retro) to finish the Delivery chip.
- Once all artifacts are in place, update chip statuses from “Draft” to “Ready” and close WBS Task 1.1.
