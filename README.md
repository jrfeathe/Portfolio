# Portfolio Web Application

This repository now tracks the documentation-first reboot of the portfolio initiative.  
The initial milestone focuses on defining scope and alignment artifacts (Task 0 from the WBS).

## Directories

- `WBS/` â€“ authoritative work breakdown structure and schema references.

## Current Deliverables

- `CHARTER.md`
- `SUCCESS_METRICS.md`
- `RISK_LOG.md`

Each document is written to satisfy the acceptance criteria in `WBS/Essential_WBS.csv`.
