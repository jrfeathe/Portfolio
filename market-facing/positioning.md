# One-line Promise

**Final**: I finish the rows I start; roots and duty run deep, so the crop stands.

**Rationale**
- Stresses end-to-end ownership and steady delivery so recruiters trust every engagement finishes strong.
- Roots-and-harvest framing cues long-term care and resilience, echoing the charter’s promise of durable, maintained systems.

**Micro (tagline)**
I finish the rows I start—steady hands, clean tools, and care after harvest, so what we ship lasts.

**Short blurb (site hero subtext)**
I don’t leave rows half-turned. I carry work from idea to running code, keep tests and docs honest, and stay after release. I call things by their right names and keep the small rites—so the product stands when the weather turns.

**Longer version (About section)**
I finish the rows I start; roots and duty run deep, so the crop stands. That means end-to-end care: sketch, build, test, deploy, watch, and mend. I practice the small rites—clean commits, measured reviews, readable code—because steadiness beats speed when seasons change. I speak plainly, keep promises, and learn the soil before I choose the tool. When storms come, I don’t blame the field; I shoulder the work and set the stakes straight.

<!--
Alternates:
- Weather shifts; I adjust. The crop matters more than the plan, and I keep it healthy.
- I talk plain, work steady, and show you each row as it’s turned so we agree on the field.
- I serve the field and those beside me; harmony feeds more than force.
Open questions:
- Confirm the hero experience keeps proof artifacts reachable within two clicks as navigation evolves.
