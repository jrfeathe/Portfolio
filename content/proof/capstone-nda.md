# NDA Client Delivery â€” Capstone Practicum

## Project Snapshot
- **Context:** Senior capstone engagement with an external sponsor under non-disclosure agreement; cadence mirrored an internship delivery pod.
- **Tech Stack:** React, JavaScript, Node.js services, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, RESTful integration layer, automated testing harness.
- **Team:** Student engineering squad collaborating with sponsor stakeholders and faculty advisor; I served as Git master and project co-lead.

## Problem Statement
The partner required a production-ready system to surface operational data securely, support advanced filtering, and hand off clean documentation despite NDA constraints.

## My Contributions
- Designed the database schema and implemented complex filtering logic that teammates initially considered infeasible.
- Owned backend workflow integration, ensuring Node.js services and REST endpoints stayed reliable and performant.
- Managed the repository as Git master, enforcing branching strategy, code review discipline, and stable releases.
- Authored documentation standards (component READMEs, API contracts, deployment notes) and modeled compliance.
- Led project rituals, resolved team conflicts, and kept the crew focused when deliverables or dynamics slipped.
- Prototyped higher-risk UI improvements, measured results, and secured stakeholder adoption after demos.

## Outcomes
- Delivered the contract scope on schedule with zero outstanding critical bugs at handoff.

## Evidence
- Pending: sanitized architecture diagram and component checklist approved for external sharing.
- Pending: faculty advisor summary or testimonial referencing delivery quality.
- Pending: redacted change log or retrospective notes (no proprietary data).

## Handling the NDA
- Do not publish partner name, proprietary data, or repository links.
- Maintain detailed private notes so specifics can be shared verbally under interview NDA when required.
