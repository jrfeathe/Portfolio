# Client Quote Framework

> Goal: send a clear fixed-scope quote in ~5 minutes.

---

## 0) Quick Metadata
- **Client / Project:** {name or company}
- **URL / Repo:** {link}
- **Service type:** {Quick Fix | Deployment & Reliability | Maintenance}
- **Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
- **Time zone:** {client time zone}

---

## 1) Understanding (Problem Summary)
Based on your message, here’s what you want:
- {Goal / symptom #1 in plain English}
- {Goal / symptom #2 in plain English}

Assumptions (if any):
- {e.g., “You have access to hosting + DNS”}
- {e.g., “This is a Next.js app deployed on X”}

---

## 2) Proposed Scope (What I’ll Do)
I will:
- {Scope item 1}
- {Scope item 2}
- {Scope item 3}
- {Scope item 4 (optional)}
- {Scope item 5 (optional)}

Notes:
- {If relevant, mention “deployment-blocking fixes included up to 2 hours”}
- {If relevant, mention “limited weekly slots / first-come first-served”}

---

## 3) Deliverables (What You’ll Receive)
You’ll get:
- **Before/after proof**: {screenshots, metrics, short video, etc.}
- **Summary of changes**: brief “what changed” note
- **Operational notes** (if relevant): {deploy/rollback steps, SSL/CDN notes}
- **Mini runbook** (deployment work): {key settings + maintenance tips}

---

## 4) Timeline (Scheduling + Turnaround)
- **Start:** next available slot after access + payment (“kickoff”)
- **Estimate:** {X} business days after kickoff
- **Client action needed to start:** {credentials, approvals, assets}

If travel / limited availability applies:
- {e.g., “Travel notice: Mar 18–Apr 9, responses may be delayed”}

---

## 5) Price + Payment
**Fixed price:** ${price}  
Payment:
- {50% upfront / 50% on delivery} **OR** {paid upfront for small tasks}

What’s included in this price:
- {1–2 bullets, e.g., “Up to 5 fixes”}
- {1 revision pass}

---

## 6) Scope Box (Hard Limits)
**Included**
- {Max fixes / max issues}
- {Max pages/components touched OR max hours}
- {1 revision pass}
- {Support window: typically 7 days for delivered changes}

**Not included**
- Full redesigns, new features, or new pages
- Copywriting/content creation (unless quoted)
- Non-deployment-related bug hunts/refactors (unless quoted)
- Ongoing support beyond the support window (unless on maintenance)

---

## 7) Change Orders (No Surprise Creep)
Anything outside the scope above:
- gets a **separate fixed quote**, or
- can be handled **hourly in 30-minute blocks** (only with your approval).

Nothing expands silently.

---

## 8) Access Checklist (Paste What Applies)
Please share:
- Hosting provider login: {yes/no}
- DNS/domain registrar access: {yes/no}
- Repo access (if needed): {yes/no}
- Error logs/screenshots (if any): {requested}
- Preferred contact + time zone: {requested}

Security preference:
- Temporary credentials preferred where possible.

---

## 9) Accept / Next Step
If this looks good, reply with:
1) “Approved”
2) Your preferred start window
3) Access details above

Then I’ll confirm kickoff and begin.
