# Content Style Guide

This guide codifies the voice and accessibility expectations for the personalization initiative. Update as new locales or modules are added.

## Personalization Tone
- **Point of view**: First-person singular when referring to Jack; second-person reserved for direct guidance. Avoid collective “we” unless citing collaborators.
- **Tonal pillars**:
  - *Straightforward warmth* — friendly, autobiographical, concise.
  - *Evidence without ego* — cite concrete achievements instead of buzzwords.
  - *Playful discipline* — light touches of personality (“G.O.A.T.: Grind, Optimize, Automate, Thrive”) without slang or meme speak.
- **Sentence craft**: One idea per sentence, varied length, trim filler. Reading level targets graduate/professional, but only use advanced vocabulary when it clarifies meaning.
- **Contractions**: Lightly discouraged. Prefer “I am,” “it is,” etc., unless the full form feels stiff.
- **CTA verbs**: Respectful imperatives such as “Download resume,” “View experience,” “Book a short intro.” Avoid salesy commands (“Act now,” “Unlock”).
- **Word list**:
  - Always OK: “portfolio,” “project,” “evidence,” “proof.”
  - Avoid: “synergy,” “leverage,” “growth hacking,” or other corporate clichés.
- **Humor**: Sparing. No emoji in body copy; emoji/icons only inside UI controls when necessary for clarity.
- **Localization**: Japanese and Chinese copy mirror English meaning with slightly heightened formality. Keep tone compassionate and concise; avoid idioms that do not translate.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Ensure high color contrast in new components; avoid light gray text on white backgrounds.
- Keyboard navigation must cover new sliders, carousel controls, and skim-mode toggle. Provide visible focus states.
- Provide descriptive alt text for portraits and tech logos. When a logo doubles as navigation, include the destination in the aria-label (e.g., “React documentation”).
- Keep sentences free of ASCII art or stylized text that might confuse screen readers.
