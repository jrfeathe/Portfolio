# Personalization Brief — Open Questions

Use this checklist to supply the missing context for Task 10a.0. Once these questions are answered, the brief and supporting artifacts can be completed without further clarification.

## Current-State Audit
- Which specific sections of the home page should be audited (hero, proof bar, sidebar CTAs, footer, etc.)? Provide the canonical section list and order.
  - Every section is being changed. All, in order.
- Are there up-to-date screenshots (light/dark, desktop/mobile) to reference? If not, can you capture them or describe when they will be available?
  - Screenshots should not be needed. We are simply changing text and reimagining components.
- What known issues or qualitative feedback already exist about tone, hierarchy, or visuals that must be captured in the audit table?
  - The color scheme is fine as is. Just the text needs updating, the image needs a quick swap, and three buttons need refreshing.

## Mood-board & Inspiration
- Which brands, portfolios, or visual references best represent “warm professionalism” for this site? Please list at least three sources with URLs.
  - Language drives this feel. It has already been adjusted in brief.md. 
  - For example, let's show the React logo in the Tech Stack section, and link the logo to https://react.dev/
  - HTML logo and link to https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
  - CSS logo and link https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html
- For each source, which adjectives (color temperature, voice, typography, motion) describe why it is inspirational?
  - The site should be kept simple and uncluttered. We aren't trying to get too fancy here. Readability and straightforwardness are priority.
- Are there any references that must be avoided (e.g., styles that feel off-brand or overused)?
  - Avoid corporate. Avoid cringe. Show compassion. Value the time of others. People don't want to read a bunch of fluff. Stay concise.

## Tonal Pillars & Voice Guardrails
- What tonal pillars should anchor the site (e.g., “calm confidence,” “evidence-forward warmth”)? Provide names plus short descriptions if already defined.
  - The tone is already established in brief.md. To the point, but fun and focused.
- Are there example sentences or microcopy snippets that illustrate the ideal tone?
  - "While the site began as a dedicated service to host my resume, it evolved into a central place for hosting my personal projects."
  - "While it is very rewarding to optimize and automate, I also find joy in learning new skills and technologies!"
- What is the desired reading level, sentence length range, and POV for primary copy blocks?
  - The desired reading level is Master's degree level, however complex words should only be used when necessary. No length constraints. POV is me writing autobiographically.
- Are there words, phrases, or metaphors that should always/never appear?
  - Corporate speak is lame and cringe. Talk like a person.

## Content Style Guide Extension
- Should contractions be encouraged or limited (e.g., “I’m,” “it’s”)?
  - Lightly discouraged.
- What pronoun rules apply when referencing Jack vs. the visitor (first-person vs. second-person vs. third-person)?
  - I'm just going to talk about myself in first person.
- What CTA verbs align with the warmer tone, and which feel too aggressive or salesy?
  - Treat the reader as highly intelligent, but don't bombard with big words. Nothing particular.
- Are there accessibility or inclusivity notes (gender-neutral language, emoji usage, multilingual considerations) that must be documented?
  - The site should be easy to navigate with a keyboard. Emojis are fine for UI indicators, but avoid in text. 
- Does the tone guidance extend to all locales/languages or only English?
  - Localization for Japanese and Chinese will convey the information as identically as possible, with a similar tone but VERY slightly more formal.

## Narrative Priorities & Module Jobs
- Which home modules are highest priority for personalization (hero, tech stack spotlight, achievements grid, etc.)? Specify each module’s narrative job to guide rewrites.
  - Rewrites for English are already complete, in brief.md.
- For every module, what is the intended personalization lever (copy update, imagery swap, layout change, interaction tweak)?
  - Whatever must be done. I have free reign here. The changes have already been documented.
- Are there dependencies on upcoming sections (e.g., new “Tech stack & skills” carousel) that should influence sequencing?
  - No.

## Asset Requirements
- Where should the new hero self-portrait originate from, and are there preferred crops/resolutions?
  - I will take a picture of myself and swap the file out. Dimensions likely 4:3.
- Which tech logos must appear in the “Tech stack & skills” carousel, and do you have licensed assets for each?
  - React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Linux, JSON, Bash, XML, KVM, QEMU, PostgreSQL, SQL, Lua, Prisma, Oracle Cloud, AWS, Stellaris Mods, Minecraft Mods. Will use licensed assets, custom assets for Minecraft and Stellaris, and placeholder text if no asset available. Use placeholder paths such as react.svg, c.svg, etc.
- Are there specific color palettes, gradients, or textures that the mood-board must include or avoid?
  - Keep colors distinct. Avoid low contrast pairings.

## Stakeholder Alignment
- Who provides final sign-off for Task 10a.0, and what constitutes approval (written note, checklist, async comment)?
  - I do. Approval means marking the task as complete.
- Is there a target date or milestone when sign-off is needed to unblock Tasks 10a.1–10a.3?
  - No.
- Should the brief record additional reviewers or accountability partners beyond the default “self” stakeholder?
  - No.

## Reference Storage & Documentation
- Where will screenshots or inspiration images be stored (`docs/personalization/reference/`)? Confirm path and file naming scheme.
  - This path is fine, however it seems unlikely that these reference images will be created.
- Should images be embedded directly in the brief, linked externally, or both?
  - Embedded is fine, but there likely won't be images.
- Are there privacy/licensing considerations when storing reference imagery that need to be documented?
  - No.

Answering these prompts will enable the personalization brief, content style guide updates, and supporting assets to be drafted without further blocking questions.
