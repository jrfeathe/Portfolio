# Infrastructure Overview

This folder keeps infrastructure tooling for the portfolio project.

- `terraform/` – IaC entry point for future cloud resources.
- `scripts/` – Helper automation and deployment scripts.

Each directory currently contains a `.gitkeep` placeholder until real assets land in later tasks.
