• Here’s how to execute Task F3.1, based on the project’s own guidance in WBS/Task_F3.1_Manual_A11y_Audit.md and the a11y runbook in docs/testing.md:

  - Prep: pick your SR tool(s) (VoiceOver on macOS, NVDA/JAWS on Windows if available), decide desktop + mobile coverage, and plan to toggle light/dark + high‑contrast modes. Run pnpm test:a11y if you want a quick baseline
    before the manual pass (docs/testing.md).
  - Create a simple audit log (markdown is fine): record page/feature, issue, severity (P0–P3), repro steps, and link to fix/issue.
  - Keyboard pass (all pages): for /[locale], /[locale]/experience, /[locale]/meetings, and ?skim:
      - Tab/shift‑tab through the full flow; ensure focus order matches the visual layout and no “dead ends.”
      - Verify focus visibility/contrast in light/dark/high‑contrast and forced‑colors.
      - Open/close chatbot and audio player: ensure focus is trapped only when open, ESC closes, and focus returns to the launcher.
      - Check skip/anchor nav (if present) and CTA/anchor states.
  - Screen reader pass (same pages):
      - Confirm landmarks and heading hierarchy are sensible and navigable.
      - Check button/link labels, ARIA on nav/accordions, and live regions for async states (chat/captcha).
      - Spot‑check locale switching for SR labels/headings.
  - Skim mode: verify skim rules don’t break tab order or anchors; resume/CTA/email/chatbot still behave correctly; no hidden nav traps.
  - Close‑out: fix or file P2/P3 issues and link them; re‑test changed areas. Final DoD is no P0/P1 outstanding with audit notes + links.

  If you want, I can draft a lightweight audit‑log template in a file (e.g., docs/a11y-audit-F3.1.md) or walk through the first page together.

##BROKEN UI FIX Notes:

home - content and CTA are pushed down. They do not share horizontal space anymore. nav shows on a y plane, then CTA on another plane, then content below that plane.

home skim - similar issues. skim toggle is jammed to the right of settings. CTA is taking ownership of an entire horizontal plane. content shows below CTA's plane.

experience - side nav takes ownership of an entire horizontal plane. The problem worsens when expanding the tree.

meetings - side nav takes ownership of entire horizontal plane.

notes - side nav takes ownership of entire horizontal plane.
